However, they end up wasting their economic resources most of the time. In such cases, options like brand licensing prove to be a significant factor in business growth. Brand licensing is a medium to connect with powerful brands in order to use their brand name and logo for your products and services. The global licensing industry has a current valuation of over 300 billion dollars, where FTV brand licensing sits at the top of the chain. In this blog, we will unveil everything you need to know about brand licensing offered by FashionTV so that you can create the right strategies for your business.</p>
                    <h2 class="main-heading bl-heading my-3 my-md-4">An Overview of <span class="fw-bold">Brand Licensing Guide</span></h2>
                    <p class="bl-paragraph my-3">Through the use of a licensor with a well-known name in the industry, brand licensing allows entrepreneurs and companies with creative concepts and strong market presence to access new revenue streams and improve their brand image. It grants the licensee a limited period of time and stipulates usage restrictions for the licensor's trademarks, logos, and other intellectual property. By employing this strategy, the licensee can capitalize on the licensor's established brand equity to market and sell products and services.</p>

Both sides evaluate the likelihood of a fruitful collaboration with the assistance of this consultation.</li>
                        <li class="bl-paragraph my-2 ms-3 ms-md-4">Submission of the Proposal: After the first meeting, the licensee can be asked to provide a formal proposal detailing their licensing strategies, including the suggested product categories, advertising tactics, and target markets.</li>
                        <li class="bl-paragraph my-2 ms-3 ms-md-4">Agreement and Negotiation: The parameters of the licensing agreement, such as the licensing costs, royalty rates, territory rights, and brand usage guidelines, are negotiated by FTV and the licensee. An official license contract is written and signed as soon as the parties come to an understanding.</li>
                        <li class="bl-paragraph my-2 ms-3 ms-md-4">Design and Development: To make sure that the licensed items adhere to FTV's brand identification, aesthetic criteria, and quality requirements, the licensee starts the process of designing and developing new products.</li>
                        <li class="bl-paragraph my-2 ms-3 ms-md-4">Submission for Approval: The licensee sends FTV product prototypes, samples, or design concepts for evaluation and clearance.
